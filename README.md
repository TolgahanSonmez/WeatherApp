# WeatherApp

- I developed Weather App to check the weather for the current location based on the GPS data from the iPhone as well as by searching for a city manually.

- I used Openweather API to get cities current weather data and 3 day / daily forecasts.

- Learn to use URLSession, RESTful API, Core Location and  Lottie animations well.
